# Writer's Block

## Abstract

Writer's Block is an application for writers who want to practice and need inspiration.  A user is able to pick an existing prompt from a list or generate a new prompt to write about.  If the user needs more inspiration, they may also generate a character or location.  Users can generate prompts, write, and read stories by other users.
